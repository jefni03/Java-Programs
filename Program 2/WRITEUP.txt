The program presorts the words in alphabetical order which has the time complexitt of O(nlog(n)). Also, n is the number of words
that are in the words.txt file.This is because the program first reads n words from the file, which takes O(n) amount of time. 
Then, it calculates the signature of each word, which takes O(klog(k)) time, where k is the length of the longest word. 
The program sorts the n signatures, which takes O(nlog(n)) time. 
It als scans the sorted list to identify records with the same signature, which takes O(n) time. 
The overall time complexity of the program is O(nlog(n)).
